<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a Stock Prices Prediction Dashboard that predicts the price of stock for a specific day using machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Linear Regression. The Flask-based dashboard provides a user interface for stock prediction and data visualization.

* Technologies Used
* Python, Flask
* Machine Learning Models: SVR, Linear Regression, Random Forests, KNN, LSTM
* Libraries: Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* Features
* Predict stock prices using machine learning
I* nteractive Flask dashboard for real-time stock predictions
* Visualizes prediction results and model performance
